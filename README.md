# Java-How-many-numbers-III
An algorithm for solving "How many numbers III?" on CodeWars that kind of works
With this solution, I was able to pass Example tests and got to the 100-103 test in Appempt testing:

I didn't pass Attempt tests because this algorithm is not fast enough - but if speed is not your concern or you looking for an example solution that you can build upon - it works as expected without any issues.
